#VisioGuide: Smart Cap for Object Detection and Navigation

   VisioGuide is a smart cap designed to assist visually impaired individuals by providing real-time object detection and
   audio feedback about their surroundings. The system utilizes a Raspberry Pi-3, a USB webcam, and TensorFlow to detect
   objects and convey information through speech synthesis.

##Project Overview

   VisioGuide aims to empower blind and visually impaired individuals by enabling them to recognize everyday objects and 
   navigate their environment independently. The system captures images in real-time using a webcam, processes them with a 
   Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and announces the detected objects via text-to-speech.

##Features

   - Real-time Object Detection: Utilizes a pre-trained CNN model to detect objects in the userâ€™s environment.
   - Audio Feedback: Converts detected object information into speech using the Pyttsx3 Text to Speech synthesizer.
   - Portable Design: Compact hardware setup allows for easy carrying and use in various environments.
